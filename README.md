 4. It will save captured screenshots with into `Ice-2014-07-13--09-13-37.png`, `Ice-2014-07-13--09-14-07.png`...

If you want to reconfigure the script, just double click `reconfigure.cmd`. If you want to use cookies instead of login and password, see [cookies authentication](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Cookies-Authentication).

### Linux/Mac OS X

 1. Unpack the archieve wherever you want
 2. Run `chmod +x ingress-ice&&./ingress-ice` in console and follow the instructions
 4. It will save captured screenshots with into `Ice-2014-07-13--09-13-37.png`, `Ice-2014-07-13--09-14-07.png`...
 5. You can run it from any folder where you want to save screenshots.

If you want to reconfigure the script, run `./ingress-ice -r` . See [CLI usage](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Linux-CLI). If you want to use cookies instead of login and password, see [cookies authentication](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Cookies-Authentication).

#### Creating videos

To create a video from your screenshots, you can use *MPlayer* [(Windows download)](http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php) (install from your repo if on linux). It includes a `mencoder` command. The following will produce an `.avi` video:
(Detailed instruction for windows [here](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Creating-videos-(Windows)))
```
mencoder mf://*.png -mf w=1366:h=768:fps=4:type=png -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell -oac copy -o ingress-ice.avi
```

Change 1366 and 768 to your width and height, fps=4 to your FPS (more FPS - faster video, but shorter)
